##### xNPM logic is based on "Multisig unconfirmed transactions" with lifetime 12 seconds(optional).
##### This means that transaction will be delivered but **never be confirmed and recorded on blockchain**.

- Application **DOESN'T** store any information
- Application works without server-side
- After refreshing page, all history will be cleared **forever** 
- The cost of unconfirmed transaction is 0 xem.
- For initiating **unconfirmed transaction** you should have some xem.
- The more balance the more message could be send at the same time.  
- The cost of registration (creation multisig account) is 0.5 xem.
